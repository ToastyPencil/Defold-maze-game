The player starts in the top right corner of the map and has to make it to the bottom left with the reverse of the starting area being present. The player can also increase the light level of the map by pressing l or q, however this will mean the timer for the monster will decrease. It is an infinite rogue like. 

The exported desktop and web versions have the movement animations for the main character not functionig. This will be fixed in a future update as the error is not present in the editor
